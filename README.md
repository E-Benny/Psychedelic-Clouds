## Psychedelic Clouds
This repository contains an HTML file that displays psychedelic moving clouds superimposed by a link to my portfolio on GitHub. This project was forked via smlsvnssn (https://codepen.io/smlsvnssn/pen/mdMPjpG). This project was developed using HTML, SCSS and RWD.

## Installation
This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install the application. Simply open the HTML file to use it. If you would like to fork the design, make sure you have a SASS Compiler installed in your Microsoft Visual Studio Code app to convert the SCSS file to CSS. Without the compiler, the SCSS version would not render any stylish changes to the HTML file.

## Project Status
The project runs as expected.The HTML file doesn't display the view, thus, you will need to view the front-end version in the link provided below.

## live Version
